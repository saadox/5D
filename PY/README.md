**THIS IS A PROTOTYPE / DEMO TO SHOW THE BASICS OF HOW WE CAN MAKE OUR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE**

Making a language is either making a compiler / Transpiler / Interpreter .
So after a meeting we've done we decided to basically make a transpiler instead because :
- Transpiler is faster than a compiler .
- Transpiler is easier than making a compiler:
	- Compiler needss a conversion to machine code.
	- Transpiler does not  since it will Depends on another PL (in this case python) and simply execute the python output.
	
	

**Only Lexer is working now , more to come soon**

> HOW TO ?

- Install Python 3.x if you have it yet .
- Run main.py  (this will Tokenize the test.lang) and then out put the whole Tokens , which are needed for  next step which is **Parser**
